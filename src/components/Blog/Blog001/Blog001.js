                  Once you start thinking about it, it is easy to get excited
                  about the opportunities that arise from having a website.
                  However, in my experience as a website designer, many businesses
                  in Kenya still do not understand the value of having one. A
                  website not only helps businesses promote and sell their
                  products and services, but it also allows them to distinguish
                  themselves from their competitors, especially for customers who
                  rely heavily on the Internet to learn everything about a
                  company.

                  A website is one of the most crucial business assets for sharing

                    access to the internet has access to your website.

                    A well put together, professional website will clearly outline
                    the products or services you provide, and it gives your
                    customer a better idea of what your business stands for. It
                    improves your chances of being found online by controlling the
                    information about your business in a manner that cannot be
                    achieved by using social media alone. Inaccurate or outdated
                    information about your business ultimately results in lost
                    business.

                    Today, people spend most of their waking hours staring at
                    screens. Be it a computer, tablet, or mobile screen. Having a
                    website for your business allows new and existing clients to
                    have access to your business 24/7. Meaning sales and bookings
                    can be made at all hours of the day from any location, whereas
                    brick and mortar businesses only work if clients come to your
                    premises.

                    A website also allows you to share updates on products or

                    drawing users back more often.

                    Having a website gives your business legitimacy. When people
